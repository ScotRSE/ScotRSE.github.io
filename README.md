## Aims

The Scottish Research Software Engineers (ScotRSE) Network has the following aims:

* Develop networks between people that do research software engineering in Scotland
* Share knowledge and experiences (e.g. training resources, advice on training / recruitment). 
* Encourage local RSE communities to form (like [CERSE](https://cerse.github.io))
* Provide logistical support and advice to local RSE communities in Scotland
* Build a national network that can advocate for RSE in Scotland

We would like to have virtual meetings, probably once a month that will be organised on a rotating basis with different organisations taking turn to host.
