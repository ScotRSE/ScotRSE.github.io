# Logo

The logo is made by combining the Scottish flag from [freesvg](https://freesvg.org/scottish-flag)
which is under the public domain and one of the UK [RSE Logos](https://github.com/rseng/logos) (Licence?). 
The ScotRSE logo will probably be made available under a CC-BY LICENCE but as it is derived from the UK RSE
logo need to wait to determine what licence they use.
